# Welcome!

SAWHET v2 is an R Shiny application that collects and validates student lab reports to ensure they are complete. [A public demo version of the application is available here.](https://yelr6j-dan-johnson.shinyapps.io/sawhet_v2_0/)

The form checks basic features such as:

* Are all of the required parts there?
* Are some sections too short or long?
* Does the text have citations in correct format in the correct sections?

Students can use SAWHET as often as they wish to check reports. When a student clicks __Download__, SAWHET merges the text, tables, figures, and metadata in one zip file that they can submit for grading. 

Unlike a report submitted as a simple document or via LMS, students are much less likely to submit incomplete work via SAWHET. Reports from SAWHET also have nearly identical structures and formats. This makes it easier for instructors to grade without focusing on formatting, and simplifies text extraction for further analysis.

## SAWHET v2.0 versus MVP

The code is released under a GNU GPL3 license for others to modify and extend. 

**Version 2.#** is under active development. All files required to set up a new instance of SAWHET v2 are from this repository. 

* Choose the __ZIP file__ to download a copy of the files without cloning the repository.
* Go to the __sawhet_v2\_#__ folder to view individual app files. 

The __MVP__ folder contains the minimum app fileset. This stripped version may be easier for other Shiny editors to adapt to their needs. This version is no longer under development.   

The __Archive__ folder contains older versions of the app that are no longer being updated.
