# Welcome!
SAWHET v2 is an R Shiny based web form that checks student lab reports to ensure they are complete. The form checks basic features such as:

* Are all of the required parts there?
* Are some sections too short or long?
* Does the text have citations in correct format in the correct sections?

Students can use SAWHET as often as they wish to check reports. When a student clicks __Download__, SAWHET merges the text, tables, figures, and metadata in one zip file that students submit for grading. 

* [Current public version of SAWHET v2](https://yelr6j-dan-johnson.shinyapps.io/sawhet_v2_0/). 
* [Minimal working version of SAWHET v2](https://yelr6j-dan-johnson.shinyapps.io/sawhet2/). 


## SAWHET v2.0 versus MVP

**Version 2.#** is under active development. All files required to set up a new instance of SAWHET v2 are from this repository. 

* Choose the __ZIP file__ to download a copy of the files without cloning the repository.
* Go to the __sawhet_v2\_#__ folder to view individual app files. 

The __MVP__ folder contains the minimum app fileset. This stripped version may be easier for other Shiny editors to adapt to their needs. This version is no longer under development.   

The __Archive__ folder contains older versions of the app that are no longer being updated.
